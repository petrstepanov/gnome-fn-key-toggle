# gnome-fn-key-toggle
A simple Linux application that toggles the FN keyboard key on linux. Quite useful for users with Macbooks or MacOS keyboards. By default the Mac keyboard uses special keys instead of the F1..F12 keys. This is quite annoying for users that work in terminal apps like Midnight Commander and others.

Program creates a desktop launcher that toggles the Function (FN) key behaviour on the keyboard. Depending on the current state of the FN key program will either lock it or unlock. The cool thing about it is that the program dynamically changes the name and icon of its own launcher to instantly reflect the change.

## How to install
Download archive and unpack or clone the Git repo. Navigate into the program folder and run `make`. Enjoy!
